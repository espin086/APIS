# Welcome to Text Sentiment API!

Use the Text Sentiment API to determine the sentiment of a document. For example, you can use sentiment analysis to determine the sentiments of comments on a blog posting to determine if your readers liked the post.

You can determine sentiment for documents in multiple languages. All documents in one job must be in the same language.

Sentiment determination returns the following values:

- Positive – The text expresses an overall positive sentiment.

- Negative – The text expresses an overall negative sentiment.

- Mixed – The text expresses both positive and negative sentiments.

- Neutral – The text does not express either positive or negative sentiments.
